# 01 - Pomodoro || Advent of JavaScript

![image](demo.gif)

This is the first exercise powered by COMPRESSED<sup>fm</sup> for the [Advent Of Javascript challenge](https://www.adventofjs.com/)

I've made this version with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Project setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
